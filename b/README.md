Problem B
=========

Loot as much as possible in a circular room for a given amount of step.

The rewards respawn after each step so they can be collected many times.

Input

Line 1: A circular list of reward

Example:
```
5
0 -1 -1 -1 0 3 -2
```

Output
------

The maximum reward.

Example:
```

```

A possible solution for this reward is `<<<><`


Limits

- The number of steps is <= 200
- The rewards are >= -500 and <= 500
- The number of rewards <= 10000
